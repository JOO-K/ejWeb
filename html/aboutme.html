    <h1>Kyung Hyun Eric is a Creative Technologist working across real-time media,
        generative AI, and experimental web projects. His practice explores how emerging
        tools can act as collaborators in storytelling, image-development,
        and human-machine interfaces.
        <br><br>He received a BFA in Graphic Design from the Rhode Island School of Design (RISD).
        After graduating, he worked as a web developer. He is currently completing a graduate degree
        in Creative Technology at Southern California Institute of Architecture (SCI-Arc).
        <br><br>
        He works fluently across a range of creative software and workflows, including ComfyUI for
        generative image systems, Unreal Engine for real-time environments, TouchDesigner for
        interactive media, and After Effects for video compositing and motion design. He also designs and 
        develops websites from scratch for creative coding purposes.
        <br><br> He is particularly interested in the cultural development of shared digital spacesâ€”how 
        collective memory, identity, and interaction are shaped through virtual platforms, tools, and aesthetics.
